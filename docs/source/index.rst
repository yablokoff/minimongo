``minimongo`` is a lightweight, schemaless, Pythonic Object-Oriented
interface to MongoDB.

It provides a very thin, dynamicly typed (schema-less) object management
layer for any data stored in any MongoDB collection. ``minimongo`` directly
calls the existing pymongo_ query syntax.

``minimongo`` can easily layer on top of existing MongoDB collections, and
will work properly with almost any existing schema, even from third party
applications.


Features
--------

* **No schema declaration**

  ``minimongo`` has *no* schema declaration whatsoever. You do not pre-declare
  the names and types of your fields. ``minimongo`` takes a minimalist and flexible
  approach to schemas.  You can set any value on any Minimongo-derived object.

* **Simple Database consistency**

  Although ``minimongo`` doesn't require to pre-declare fields, it has simple
  facility to maintain data consistency with DBRefs. You can specify relational fields
  and action on delete - ``NOTHING``, ``NULLIFY``, ``DENY``  and ``CASCADE``.

* **Automatic MongoDB Connection management and connection pooling**

  ``minimongo`` automatically connects to your database for you, and has its
  own simple Connection pool. Connections are persistent and last the lifetime
  of your application.

* **Friendly support for DBRef types**

  ``minimongo`` can easily generate fully-specified DBRef objects, and store
  these into fields. Fetching via DBRef is simplified as well.

* **Uses pymongo's native query syntax**

  Query methods are passed directly to pymongo_'s API. ``minimongo`` provides
  very few custom methods, and delegates nearly all operations directly to
  pymongo_. This means as features are added to pymongo_, they will be
  automatically accessible via ``minimongo``.

* **Easy index creation and management**

  Indices for a given collection can be specified at declaration time. This
  results in automatic calls to :meth:`pymongo.collection.Collection.ensure_index`
  method at the time your program starts up. Therefore, all the proper indices
  for your collections are always in place.
